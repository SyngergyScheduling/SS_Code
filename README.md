This is where it gets real

Eventually I will set up a better server on the pi that runs on port 80 but right now it's just the default webrick server bundled with ruby on rails.

# Server information
* Raspberry pi 2
* Arch Linux (so the latest of the latest software)
* ruby version 2.3.1
* rails version 5.0.0.1

# Guidelines
* Please don't `git push origin master`, doing that too much would likely blow up the pi and burn my house down.
* Read the style guides.
* These are guidelines.
